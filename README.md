# GDS_ionospheric_tools
This repository contains scripts to analyse, process, and visualise magnetic daily variation (DV) signals of ionospheric origin to probe mantle electrical conductivity distributions in Geomagnetic Depth Sounding (GDS) studies. Most of these scripts were developed during my PhD in ETH-Zürich and under the supervision of prof. Dr. Alexey Kuvshinov.
This work is based on the theoretical framework presented in: Guzavina, M., Grayver, A., & Kuvshinov, A., 2019. Probing upper mantle electrical conductivity with daily magnetic variations using global to local transfer functions, Geophysical Journal International, 219(3), 2125–2147.

## Included Tools

- Download of geomagnetic observatory data 
- Daily variation preprocessing and visualisation
- Sq Global-to-local (G2L) transfer function estimation
- Simulation of daily variations in a 1-D spherical Earth

## Status

These tools are not fully polished packages, but are shared here for transparency and as part of my scientific portfolio.
